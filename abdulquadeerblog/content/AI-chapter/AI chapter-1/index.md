# Problem Solving & Search

## Introduction to Intelligence

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is a multidisciplinary field that seeks to create intelligent agents capable of emulating human-like behaviors such as problem-solving, learning, understanding natural language, and interacting with the environment.

- AI encompasses a wide range of techniques and methodologies for building intelligent systems.

## Foundations of Artificial Intelligence

- AI draws on several foundational components:
  - **Machine Learning**: Algorithms and models that enable machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time.
  
  - **Knowledge Representation**: Methods for storing, organizing, and reasoning with information in a way that machines can utilize.
  
  - **Problem Solving**: Developing algorithms to find solutions to complex problems.
  
  - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Techniques for understanding and generating human language.
  
  - **Computer Vision**: Enabling machines to interpret visual information from images or videos.

- AI systems often combine these foundational elements to achieve intelligent behavior.

## History of AI

- The history of AI can be divided into several key phases:
  - **Early Foundations (1950s-1960s)**: The term "artificial intelligence" was first coined, and early AI programs were developed. This period was marked by optimism and high expectations.

  - **AI Winter (1970s-1980s)**: Funding and interest in AI waned due to unrealistic expectations, limited computational power, and modest progress. Research slowed during this period.

  - **Resurgence (late 20th century)**: Advances in machine learning, expert systems, and neural networks reignited interest in AI.

  - **Contemporary AI (21st century)**: Recent progress in deep learning, reinforcement learning, and the availability of vast amounts of data have propelled AI into diverse applications, including self-driving cars, natural language processing, and more.

## Structure of Agents

- In the context of AI, an **agent** is a system that perceives its environment through sensors and takes actions using actuators. Agents can range from simple to complex.

- Key components of an agent include:
  - **Sensors**: These devices collect information from the environment. Sensors can include cameras, microphones, or other sensors specific to the agent's function.
  
  - **Actuators**: These mechanisms execute actions in the environment, such as moving a robot's wheels or generating text on a screen.
  
  - **Knowledge Base**: An internal storage system that retains information and knowledge necessary for decision-making.
  
  - **Inference Engine**: The component of the agent responsible for reasoning and making decisions based on the knowledge it possesses.

# Problem Solving

## Formulating Problems

- In AI, problem-solving involves finding a sequence of actions that transforms an initial state into a goal state. This process is vital for tasks like planning and decision-making.

- Problems are typically formulated with three main components:
  - **Initial State**: The starting configuration or situation.
  
  - **Goal State**: The desired outcome or target configuration.
  
  - **Operators**: Actions that can be applied to states, leading to state transitions.

- The solution to a problem is a sequence of operators that, when applied to the initial state, results in the goal state.

## Problem Types

- Problems in AI can be categorized based on various characteristics:
  - **Deterministic**: Problems where outcomes are entirely predictable and free from randomness. Chess is a deterministic game.
  
  - **Nondeterministic**: Problems with an element of randomness or uncertainty. Card games involve nondeterministic elements.
  
  - **Sequential**: Problems where the order of decisions and actions significantly impacts future states. Chess is an example of a sequential game.
  
  - **Adversarial**: Competitive problems where two or more agents have conflicting goals. Games like chess and tic-tac-toe are adversarial problems.

## States and Operators

- In problem-solving, a **state** represents a particular configuration or situation within the problem space. It is a snapshot of the problem at a specific point in time.

- **Operators** are actions that can be applied to states, leading to state transitions. These operators define the legal moves or transformations in the problem space.

- For instance, in the 8-Puzzle problem, states are different configurations of the puzzle board, and operators are the actions of moving a tile to an adjacent empty space.

## State Space

- The **state space** of a problem comprises all possible states that can be reached from the initial state by applying operators. It represents the entire landscape of the problem.

- State spaces can vary in size and complexity. For some problems, exploring the entire state space may be computationally infeasible.

## Search Strategies

- **Search strategies** are algorithms used to explore the state space and find solutions to problems. Common search strategies include:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: BFS explores all neighbors of a state before moving deeper into the state space. It is guaranteed to find the shortest path to the goal if the state space is finite and unweighted.
  
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: DFS explores as far as possible along one branch of the state space tree before backtracking. It is often used when memory is limited, and it may not necessarily find the shortest path.
  
  - **Uniform Cost Search**: This strategy expands nodes with the lowest path cost, making it suitable for problems where different operators have different costs.

### Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm

Breadth-First Search explores the state space level by level, expanding all nodes at a given level before moving to the next level. It is implemented using a queue data structure.

```python
# Pseudocode for Breadth-First Search
function BFS(initial_state, goal_state):
    initialize an empty queue
    enqueue initial_state
    while the queue is not empty:
        current_state = dequeue from the queue
        if current_state is the goal_state:
            return solution path
        for each successor_state of current_state:
            if successor_state has not been visited:
                enqueue successor_state
                mark successor_state as visited
    return no solution found
```

### Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm

Depth-First Search explores the state space by traversing as deeply as possible along a branch before backtracking. It is implemented using a stack or recursion.

```python
# Pseudocode for Depth-First Search
function DFS(current_state, goal_state):
    if current_state is the goal_state:
        return solution path
    for each successor_state of current_state:
        if successor_state has not been visited:
            result = DFS(successor_state, goal_state)
            if result is a solution path:
                return result
    return no solution found
```

## Informed Search Strategies

- Informed search strategies use domain-specific knowledge to guide the search more efficiently. These strategies are especially valuable when the state space is large.

- **Best-First Search**: This algorithm selects the node that is closest to the goal state based on an evaluation function. The evaluation function is typically a heuristic that estimates the cost from the current state to the goal.

- **A* Algorithm**: A* combines the cost of the path from the initial state with a heuristic that estimates the cost

 from the current state to the goal. It uses the sum of these two values to guide the search. A* is optimal and complete if the heuristic is admissible and consistent.

## Heuristic Functions

- A **heuristic function** provides an estimate of the cost from a given state to the goal state. It is crucial for informed search algorithms such as A*.

- A heuristic function should have two essential properties:
  - **Admissibility**: It should never overestimate the true cost to reach the goal from the current state. If a heuristic is admissible, A* is guaranteed to find the optimal solution.
  
  - **Consistency**: The heuristic should satisfy the triangle inequality, ensuring that it provides meaningful guidance during the search.

- Example of a heuristic for the 8-Puzzle problem: The number of misplaced tiles is a simple heuristic. It counts the number of tiles in the current state that are not in their correct positions. This heuristic is admissible but not always consistent.

```python
# Example Heuristic for 8-Puzzle: Number of misplaced tiles
def heuristic(state, goal):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(state)):
        if state[i] != goal[i]:
            count += 1
    return count
```

## Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*)

- **Iterative Deepening A*** (IDA*) is an advanced search algorithm that combines the principles of A* with depth-first search. It is often used when memory is limited, but a near-optimal solution is required.

- The algorithm starts with a shallow depth limit and gradually increases it with each iteration until it finds a solution.

- IDA* uses the A* heuristic and is designed to find the optimal solution when a consistent heuristic is used.

# Adversarial Search/Game Playing

## Perfect Decision Game

- In a perfect decision game, both players have complete knowledge of the game and can see the entire game tree. They make optimal decisions to maximize their chances of winning.

- The classic algorithm for perfect information games is the Minimax Algorithm.

### Minimax Algorithm

- The Minimax Algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in perfect decision games like chess and tic-tac-toe.

- It operates on the principle of minimizing the possible loss for a worst-case scenario. In the context of game playing, it means that each player assumes that their opponent makes optimal moves to maximize their own outcome.

- The algorithm is based on a tree structure, with nodes representing game states and edges representing possible moves.

```python
# Pseudocode for Minimax Algorithm
function minimax(node, depth, maximizingPlayer):
    if depth is 0 or node is a terminal node:
        return the heuristic value of node
    
    if maximizingPlayer:
        bestValue = -∞
        for child in node's children:
            value = minimax(child, depth - 1, False)
            bestValue = max(bestValue, value)
        return bestValue
    else:
        bestValue = +∞
        for child in node's children:
            value = minimax(child, depth - 1, True)
            bestValue = min(bestValue, value)
        return bestValue
```

## Imperfect Decision Game

- In an imperfect decision game, not all information is available to the players. There may be hidden information, uncertainty, or randomness involved.

- Alpha-Beta Pruning is a critical optimization technique to improve the efficiency of the Minimax Algorithm in these games.

### Alpha-Beta Pruning

- Alpha-Beta Pruning is a search algorithm enhancement that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the Minimax Algorithm.

- It uses two values, alpha and beta, to keep track of the best values found so far for the maximizing and minimizing players, respectively.

- Alpha represents the best value found for the maximizing player, and beta represents the best value for the minimizing player.

- The algorithm prunes branches of the search tree that cannot lead to better results. If alpha becomes greater than or equal to beta, a branch can be safely pruned.

```python
# Pseudocode for Alpha-Beta Pruning
function alpha_beta(node, depth, alpha, beta, maximizingPlayer):
    if depth is 0 or node is a terminal node:
        return the heuristic value of node
    
    if maximizingPlayer:
        for child in node's children:
            alpha = max(alpha, alpha_beta(child, depth - 1, alpha, beta, False))
            if beta ≤ alpha:
                break
        return alpha
    else:
        for child in node's children:
            beta = min(beta, alpha_beta(child, depth - 1, alpha, beta, True))
            if beta ≤ alpha:
                break
        return beta
```
