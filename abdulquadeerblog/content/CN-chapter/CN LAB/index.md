# Program-1 : Network Command Explanation

## `tcpdump`

`tcpdump` is a packet analyzer tool that allows you to capture and analyze network traffic. You can adjust the interface and packet count as needed for your specific use case.

## `netstat`

`netstat` is a command-line utility for displaying network statistics, including open ports and active network connections. The command `netstat -tuln` shows listening TCP and UDP ports.

## `ifconfig`

`ifconfig` is used to display and configure network interface parameters, including IP addresses, netmasks, and more. It provides information about the network interfaces on your system.

## `nslookup`

`nslookup` is a network utility for performing DNS (Domain Name System) lookups. In the provided example, it performs a DNS lookup for 'example.com', returning information about the domain's IP addresses.

## FTP

FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server. To interact with FTP programmatically, you should use dedicated FTP client libraries in C, as the command-line `ftp` client may not be suitable for automation.

## TELNET

TELNET is a network protocol that allows terminal access to remote systems. To interact with TELNET servers programmatically, you'll need to use a TELNET library or API, as it's not straightforward to automate using a command-line program.

## `traceroute`

`traceroute` is a network diagnostic tool used to trace the route that packets take from your computer to a destination host (e.g., 'example.com'). It displays a list of intermediate routers and their response times.

Please note that some of these services/commands may require additional configuration, and some may not be available on all systems. The specific options and usage may vary depending on your operating system and network setup.


```c
// Program containing all commands in switch 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int choice;
    
    while (1) {
        printf("Select an option:\n");
        printf("1. Run tcpdump\n");
        printf("2. Run netstat\n");
        printf("3. Run ifconfig\n");
        printf("4. Run nslookup\n");
        printf("5. Run FTP\n");
        printf("6. Run TELNET\n");
        printf("7. Run traceroute\n");
        printf("8. Exit\n");

        printf("Enter your choice: ");
        scanf("%d", &choice);
        
        switch (choice) {
            case 1:
                system("tcpdump -i eth0"); // Replace 'eth0' with your network interface
                break;
            case 2:
                system("netstat -tuln");
                break;
            case 3:
                system("ifconfig");
                break;
            case 4:
                printf("Enter the hostname to look up: ");
                char hostname[256];
                scanf("%s", hostname);
                char nslookupCommand[256];
                sprintf(nslookupCommand, "nslookup %s", hostname);
                system(nslookupCommand);
                break;
            case 5:
                system("ftp"); // This will start an interactive FTP session
                break;
            case 6:
                system("telnet"); // This will start an interactive TELNET session
                break;
            case 7:
                printf("Enter the destination IP or hostname for traceroute: ");
                char dest[256];
                scanf("%s", dest);
                char tracerouteCommand[256];
                sprintf(tracerouteCommand, "traceroute %s", dest);
                system(tracerouteCommand);
                break;
            case 8:
                exit(0);
            default:
                printf("Invalid choice. Please try again.\n");
        }
    }

    return 0;
